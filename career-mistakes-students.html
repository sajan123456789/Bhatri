<h2>Why Students Make Career Mistakes</h2>
<p>
Career decisions are often made at a young age, when students have limited exposure
to real-world professions. Pressure from family, society, marks, and trends
often leads to wrong choices that cause stress and dissatisfaction later in life.
</p>

<h2>Top Career Mistakes Students Should Avoid</h2>

<h3>1. Choosing a Stream Only Based on Marks</h3>
<p>
Many students select Science, Commerce, or Arts purely based on exam scores.
High marks do not always mean interest or aptitude for that stream.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Marks ≠ long-term success</li>
<li>Interest and ability matter more</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Following Peer Pressure</h3>
<p>
Friends choosing a particular stream or exam often influence decisions.
What works for someone else may not suit your skills or personality.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid copying friends blindly</li>
<li>Focus on personal strengths</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Running After “Trending” Careers Only</h3>
<p>
Careers like Engineering, Medical, or Data Science look attractive,
but not everyone enjoys or succeeds in them.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Trends change quickly</li>
<li>Skills and interest stay long-term</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Ignoring Skill-Based Career Options</h3>
<p>
Many students believe success is possible only through degrees.
In reality, skill-based careers offer excellent income and growth.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Web development</li>
<li>Digital marketing</li>
<li>Design & creative fields</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Obsessing Over One Exam Only</h3>
<p>
Preparing only for one competitive exam without backup options
creates extreme pressure and risk.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Always keep Plan B</li>
<li>Explore multiple career paths</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Not Researching Career Scope</h3>
<p>
Choosing a course without understanding job roles, salary,
and future growth leads to regret later.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Check industry demand</li>
<li>Understand real job roles</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Ignoring Mental Health & Stress</h3>
<p>
Constant comparison, exam pressure, and fear of failure
harm mental health and performance.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Take breaks</li>
<li>Balance study and life</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Avoid These Career Mistakes</h2>
<div class="box">
<ul>
<li>Understand your interests honestly</li>
<li>Take aptitude and career assessments</li>
<li>Talk to mentors and professionals</li>
<li>Research careers deeply before choosing</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Final Advice for Students</h2>
<p>
There is no single “perfect” career for everyone.
Success comes from clarity, consistency, and self-awareness.
Avoid rushing decisions — your career is a long-term journey, not a race.
