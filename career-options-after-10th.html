      Choosing the right career after Class 10 is one of the most important decisions in a student’s
      life. At this stage, students often feel confused due to pressure from parents, relatives,
      marks, or societal expectations. However, selecting a stream or course without understanding
      personal interest and aptitude can lead to dissatisfaction later.

      alternative pathways such as diploma, ITI, and skill-based programs. Each option has its own
