      CareerSteps is a student-focused career guidance platform designed to help
      school students make informed and confident career choices after Class 10
      and Class 12. We understand that choosing the right stream or career path is

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      Many students choose streams or careers due to peer pressure, family

      CareerSteps was created to solve this exact problem. Our goal is to provide
      clear, unbiased and structured guidance so that students can understand
      their options before making life-changing decisions.
