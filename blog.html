<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Career Options After Class 10 in India</h2>
<p>
Choosing a career after Class 10 is a life-shaping decision. At this stage, students are not only
selecting subjects but also defining the direction of their professional future. Science, Commerce,
and Arts are the traditional streams, but today students also have access to diploma, vocational,
and skill-based programs.
</p>
<p>
Science stream is ideal for students interested in engineering, medical, research, or technology-driven
careers. Commerce stream builds strong foundations in finance, accounting, business management,
and economics. Arts stream focuses on humanities, law, civil services, journalism, psychology,
political science, and creative fields.
</p>
<p>
In addition, students can opt for ITI courses, polytechnic diplomas, digital skills, and early
career certifications. These programs allow faster entry into the job market and are highly
valuable in practical industries.

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Best Career Choices After 12th</h2>
<p>
After completing Class 12, career options expand significantly. Science students can pursue
engineering, medicine, biotechnology, data science, artificial intelligence, or pure sciences.
Commerce students can explore CA, CS, CMA, B.Com, MBA, finance, economics, or entrepreneurship.
Arts students can choose law, UPSC, media, design, psychology, teaching, or social sciences.
</p>
<p>

job satisfaction, and future scope must be considered carefully.

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Science vs Commerce vs Arts – Which Stream Is Right?</h2>
<p>
There is no superior stream. The right stream depends on individual strengths, interests, and
learning style. Science requires analytical thinking and problem solving. Commerce suits students
interested in numbers, finance, and business strategy. Arts favors communication, creativity,
critical thinking, and social understanding.
</p>
<p>
CareerSteps AI helps students identify the most suitable stream using aptitude analysis instead
of peer pressure or societal expectations.
